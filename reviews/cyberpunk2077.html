  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☑ <strong>Exceptional</strong> – Stunning visuals that make the world come alive</li>
    <li>☐ Great – Beautiful, with minor imperfections</li>
    <li>☐ Good – Solid, no major issues, but nothing groundbreaking</li>
    <li>☐ Decent – Gets the job done, but not impressive</li>
    <li>☐ Bad – Below average, with noticeable flaws</li>
    <li>☐ Terrible – Unpleasant, detracts from the experience</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>The graphics presented in The Last of Us Part II Remastered are among the best ever shown in a video game. The meticulous detail that was put into everything visible on screen shows how much of a labor of love this game was, and how important the characters and their world are to the developers. Every single moment can stand on its own as a work of art worthy of being put on display.</p>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☑ <strong>Excellent</strong> – Fun, engaging, and highly polished</li>
    <li>☐ Good – Works well, but could use more depth</li>
    <li>☐ Average – It's fine, but nothing special</li>
    <li>☐ Below Average – Has issues or gets repetitive quickly</li>
    <li>☐ Poor – Frustrating or unrefined mechanics</li>
    <li>☐ Unplayable – Mechanics are broken or poorly executed</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>What is it, if not perfect? The fluidity with which the characters move, the seamless, realistic transition from one animation to the next, the fun and engaging gameplay loop that stays fresh with every new level and interaction. Simply flawless.</p>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☑ <strong>Exceptional</strong> – Music and sound design are unforgettable</li>
    <li>☐ Great – Well done, really enhances the game</li>
    <li>☐ Good – Works fine, nothing too remarkable</li>
    <li>☐ Average – Not bad, but lacks impact</li>
    <li>☐ Poor – Distracting or unpolished sound</li>
    <li>☐ Terrible – Unbearable, drags the experience down</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>An audiophiles dream. To put this into perspective, the audio design in this game is so beyond good, that a blind person can beat this game in it's entirety. While that certainly says a ton about the accessibility options available in this game (which are seemingly infinite) it also says that Naughty Dog put as much effort into the audio as they did every other aspect of the game. The dialogue sounds like its coming from the characters where they are in relation to the player, rather than sounding flat. Sound mastering changes with the environment; for example, firing a gun in a silo causes a deafening bang, causing the characters to react. The soundtrack is beautiful and is a perfect match for the tone of the games story. Highly immersive audio for a highly immersive game.</p>

  <h2>PC Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Basic – Can run on the most minimal setups</li>
    <li>☐ Moderate – Runs fine on mid-range PCs</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>High-end</strong> – Requires a solid gaming machine to perform well</li>
    <li>☐ Top-tier – Only runs well on the latest hardware</li>
    <li>☐ Super High – A beast of a system needed to run smoothly</li>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Game Size</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Small – Kilobytes or Megabytes (tiny, like retro games)</li>
    <li>☐ Moderate – 1-10 GB (typical for small-to-medium games)</li>
    <li>☐ Large – 11-50 GB (a good chunk of storage used)</li>
    <li>☐ Very Large – 51-100 GB (takes up a lot of space)</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Massive</strong> – 101-150 GB (seriously, free up some space)</li>
    <li>☐ Gigantic – Over 150 GB (dedicate an entire hard drive for this game)</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC requires a whopping 115.79 GB installation at of the time of writing this. This game is NOT small. When you are in game, it is easy to see why that is.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Difficulty</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Very Easy – Anyone can pick it up and play</li>
    <li>☐ Easy – Simple to learn and finish</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Medium</strong> – Easy to pick up, but challenging to master</li>
    <li>☐ Hard – Requires a lot of skill and attention</li>
    <li>☐ Very Hard – Only for hardcore gamers</li>
    <li>☐ **Dark Souls** – Prepare to lose your mind</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>While there is a difficulty selection in this game, even playing on the normal difficulty mode poses some unexpected challenges that will require you to assess the situation strategically and plan your approach to different situations. The enemy AI is very smart and will strategize their approach to you just as well. Too easy for you? Crank it up to Grounded difficulty, where resources are scarce, enemy intelligence is cranked up to 11, companions provide little to no assistance in combat, you have no HUD or Listen Mode, and checkpoints are fewer and farther between. Still too easy? Enable Permadeath for full Masochist mode.</p>

</div>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Grind</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☑ <strong>No Grind</strong> – No grinding needed, progress feels natural</li>
    <li>☐ Light Grind – Optional grind if you want to go the extra mile</li>
    <li>☐ Moderate Grind – Some grinding required to progress at a reasonable pace</li>
    <li>☐ Heavy Grind – Takes up too much time, not worth it</li>
    <li>☐ Excessive Grind – Feels like a second job</li>
    <li>☐ Endless Grind – Good luck, you’ll need it</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>That is the nature of story driven games like this. No grind. No leveling up.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ No Story – Just gameplay, no narrative</li>
    <li>☐ Minimal Story – Some lore but no significant plot</li>
    <li>☐ Average – Basic story, gets the job done</li>
    <li>☐ Good – Solid story with good character development</li>
    <li>☐ Great – Excellent writing and emotional depth</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Exceptional</strong> – One of the best stories in gaming</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>I hold the story of The Last of Us Part II in the highest regard—not just as a game, but as one of the most powerful narratives I've ever experienced in any medium. It's hauntingly beautiful, unflinchingly tragic, and emotionally devastating. The game is a masterclass in character study, using the cycle of vengeance and justice to force the player into uncomfortable moral territory. What sets it apart is how it doesn't just ask you to witness its themes—it makes you live them through its characters. It's a story that breaks you down, piece by piece, and yet somehow finds beauty in the ruin. This story will stick with me for the rest of my life.</p>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Game Time</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Very short – Shorter than expected, maybe a few hours</li>
    <li>☐ Short – Can be finished in a single weekend</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Average</strong> – Just the right length, not too long or short</li>
    <li>☐ Long – A big investment of time, but rewarding</li>
    <li>☐ Endless – Takes forever to finish, massive time commitment</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>With a main story averaging around 24 hours, The Last of Us Part II Remastered delivers a full, impactful experience without overstaying its welcome. For those craving more, the new “No Return” mode offers extended replayability. This roguelike survival mode lets you choose a character and progress through randomized combat scenarios, upgrading your skills and weapons along the way, culminating in a boss fight at the end of each run.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Price</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ Free – No cost, so just grab it</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Worth the Price</strong> – You’re getting great value</li>
    <li>☐ If it’s on sale – Consider buying it on discount</li>
    <li>☐ If you have extra money – Not essential, but worth it if you can spare it</li>
    <li>☐ Not recommended – Better options out there for your money</li>
    <li>☐ Overpriced – You’ll regret spending this much</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>At full price, this game more than delivers. What you will get out of this game is beyond whatever price they could put on it. Luckily for us, the game launched on PC for $49.99 in the USA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="category">
  <h2>Bugs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>☐ No bugs – Runs perfectly with no issues</li>
    <li>☑ <strong>Minor Bugs</strong> – A few small bugs, but nothing major</li>
    <li>☐ Annoying – Bugs that pop up here and there, causing frustration</li>
    <li>☐ Frequent – Bugs are common, but the game is still playable</li>
    <li>☐ Major – Game-breaking bugs that ruin the experience</li>
  </ul>
<button class="dropdown-btn">Explanation</button>
<div class="dropdown-content">
  <p>At the time of writing this, The Last of Us Part II Remastered does have a few bugs—much like the PC port of Part I. In No Return mode, some players have experienced graphical issues, such as parts of the map disappearing. The frequent loading in this mode can also be a drawback, with load times sometimes taking 30 seconds to a full minute between scenarios. Thankfully, these times tend to improve with repeated play, but they may still be frustrating for some.</p>
